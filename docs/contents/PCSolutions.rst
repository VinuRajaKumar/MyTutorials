5. Windows: Ignore errors with Xcopy and RoboCopy
#################################################

To copy entire directory structures as quickly as possible and ignore all disk errors (useful in data recovery) either of the following commands should work with robocopy being the quickest (if youâ€™ve got Vista/7 or XP with the XP Resource Kit installed). Both commands use source -> destination path order.

xcopy /C/H/R/S/Y c:\ d:\

/C = Continues copying even if errors occur
/H = Copies hidden and system files also
/R = Overwrites read-only files
/S = Copies directories and subdirectories
/Y = Overwrites existing files without asking

robocopy c:\ d:\ /MIR /R:0 /W:0

/MIR = Mirror entire directory structure (can use /E instead)
/R:0 = 0 retries for read/write failures
/W:0 = 0 seconds between retries
